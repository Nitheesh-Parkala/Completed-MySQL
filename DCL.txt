DCL(DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE)
=============================
GRANT: THIS SATEMENT IS USED TO GRANT THE PREMISSION TO ACESS THE DATA FOR THE OTHER USER.
SYNTAX: GRANT sql_statemnt ON table_name
         TO 'user_name'@'localhost';

REVOKE:THIS STATEMNT IS USED TO TAKE BACK THE PREMISSIN FROM THE OTHER USER.
SYNTAX: REVOKE sql_statement ON table_name
        FROM 'user_name'@'localhost';

key attributes:
===============
1) superkey:
============
super key is the combination and It is used to make one records as unique.

2)candidate key:
 =============
It is a minmal subset of super key

3)primary key:
==============
it is the unique idenetifier in the data base table and it should not be null.

4) foreign key:
===============
It is used to estabilsh the realtionship between two tables.

5)composite key:
================
It is the combination two or more key attributes.

6)compund key:
=============
It is the combination two or more key attributes atleast one must be a foriegn key.

Total Functional DependencY:
=============================
here each all  key attirubute is depends one one key attribute

Portial Functional Depedecy
===========================
here we r composite the two key  into one and other key attirubutes are depneds one they.

Transitive Functional Dependecy.
===============================
here each key attribute will depend on the one key attribute also from each key there also one key attribute will depend on each other.

REDUANDENCY:
===========
PROCESS OF REMOVONG REPITION OR DUPLICATE DATA FROM THE TABLE.


NORMALIZATION:
==============
PROCESS OF SPLITING LARGER TABLE INTO SMALLER TABLE IS CALLED NORAMILZATION to provide redanducy and anomoly.

ANOMOLY:
============
THE PROBLEMS CAUSED DUE TO DML OPERATION.


1NF:
====
THE TABLE MUST NOT CONTAIN ANY DUPLICATE RECORDS.
THE DATA INSIDE THE CELL MUST BEA SINGLE VALUE DATA OR ATOMIC DATA.
