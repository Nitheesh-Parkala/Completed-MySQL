TCL:TRANSACTION CONTROL LANGUAGE
=======================================
COMMIT: IT USED TO SAVE ALL THE TRANSCATIONS PREMENTALY INSIDE THE DATA BASE.
SYNTAX: COMMIT;

NOTE: To disable auto commit in MySQL,we use 
SET AUTOCOMMIT=0;

ROLLBACK: It is used to roll out all the transcations untill the previously use commit statement.
Syntax: ROLLBACK;

1) we can alo rollback upto a certain savepoint.
Syntax: ROLLBACK TO savepoint_name;

SAVEPOINT:It is used to mark a point in the middle of the transaction.
Syntax: SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;


Scenario:
You have a Customers table and want to perform multiple updates as a single transaction. If something goes wrong, you want to be able to roll back to a savepoint.

1. Create the Customers table for the example

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Balance DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

2. Insert some initial data:
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, Name, Balance) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 100.00),
(2, 'Bob', 150.00),
(3, 'Charlie', 200.00);

3. Start a transaction and use savepoints:
-- Start the transaction
START TRANSACTION;

-- Create a savepoint
SAVEPOINT BeforeUpdate;

-- Perform some updates
UPDATE Customers SET Balance = Balance - 50 WHERE CustomerID = 1;  -- Alice's balance reduced
UPDATE Customers SET Balance = Balance - 30 WHERE CustomerID = 2;  -- Bob's balance reduced

-- Create another savepoint
SAVEPOINT AfterPartialUpdate;

-- Perform more updates
UPDATE Customers SET Balance = Balance - 20 WHERE CustomerID = 3;  -- Charlie's balance reduced

-- Suppose we encounter an issue and want to roll back to the first savepoint
ROLLBACK TO BeforeUpdate;

-- If everything is fine, commit the transaction
-- COMMIT;

-- Rollback to undo all changes made during the transaction
-- ROLLBACK;

Summary:
COMMIT: Saves all changes made during the transaction permanently.
ROLLBACK: Can only be used to undo changes made during a transaction if a commit has not been issued. After a commit, rollback has no effect because the changes are already saved.
